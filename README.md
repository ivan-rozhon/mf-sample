# Angular Module Federation Sample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2, uses [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) library and implementation of the micro frontends is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD8VaBdU1f8). Thanks Mandred!

## Development server

Run `npm run start:all` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the shell that contains routes to the 2 micro front-ends (MF1 and MF2), which are also served separately on `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:4000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
